# Enhanced Claim Decomposition - Context Preservation Solution

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: When fact-checking "Protests in Nepal occurred due to social media bans", the system would break it into:
1. ‚úÖ "Protests occurred in Nepal" 
2. ‚ùå "Protests were due to social media ban" (LOST Nepal context!)

This caused irrelevant evidence retrieval (e.g., protests in France) and poor fact-checking accuracy.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

**Enhanced Context Preservation**: The system now generates:
1. ‚úÖ "Protests occurred in Nepal"
2. ‚úÖ "Protests in Nepal were due to social media bans" (Nepal context PRESERVED!)
3. ‚úÖ "Social media bans were imposed in Nepal"

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **`factcheck/config/sample_prompt.yaml`** - Enhanced YAML prompt configuration
2. **`factcheck/utils/prompt/chatgpt_prompt.py`** - Enhanced ChatGPT prompts
3. **`factcheck/utils/prompt/claude_prompt.py`** - Enhanced Claude prompts

### Key Enhancements:
- **Context Preservation Rules**: Explicit instructions to maintain geographical, temporal, and entity context
- **Better Examples**: Added 5 comprehensive examples covering different context types
- **Causal Relationships**: Improved handling of cause-effect relationships
- **Gemini Optimization**: Specifically optimized for Gemini API responses

## üìä Test Results

### ‚úÖ Success Cases (Verified Working):

1. **Nepal Protests**: 
   ```
   Input: "Protests in Nepal occurred due to social media bans"
   Output: 
   - "Protests occurred in Nepal"
   - "Protests in Nepal were due to social media bans" ‚úÖ Context preserved!
   - "Social media bans were imposed in Nepal"
   ```

2. **Elon Musk X Purchase**:
   ```
   Input: "Did Elon Musk buy X in 2023?"
   Output:
   - "Elon Musk bought X"
   - "Elon Musk bought X in 2023" ‚úÖ Entity + temporal context preserved!
   ```

3. **Complex Multi-Context**:
   ```
   Input: "Apple announced iPhone 15 launch in California during September 2023"
   Output:
   - "Apple announced iPhone 15 launch"
   - "Apple announced iPhone 15 launch in California" ‚úÖ Geographic context
   - "Apple announced iPhone 15 launch in September 2023" ‚úÖ Temporal context
   - "iPhone 15 launch occurred in California during September 2023" ‚úÖ Combined context
   ```

## üåê Integration Status

### ‚úÖ Seamless Integration:
- **Web App** (`webapp.py`): Works with enhanced decomposition automatically
- **CLI Interface** (`__main__.py`): Benefits from improved context preservation  
- **Library Usage** (`factcheck/__init__.py`): Enhanced results through existing API
- **Multimodal Processing**: Works with text, image, and video inputs

### ‚úÖ Backward Compatibility:
- All existing code works unchanged
- Same interfaces, better results
- No performance impact
- Maintains all existing functionality

## üéâ Benefits Achieved

1. **More Relevant Evidence**: Context-aware claims retrieve targeted evidence
2. **Better Accuracy**: Reduced false positives from irrelevant sources
3. **Maintained Atomicity**: Claims remain atomic while preserving crucial context
4. **Universal Improvement**: All interfaces benefit automatically

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Web Interface:
```bash
python webapp.py --api_config api_config.yaml
# Navigate to http://localhost:2024
# Enter: "Protests in Nepal occurred due to social media bans"
# See enhanced context preservation in action!
```

### Command Line:
```bash
python -m factcheck --modal string --input "Did Elon Musk buy X in 2023?" --api_config api_config.yaml
```

### Library:
```python
from factcheck import FactCheck
factcheck = FactCheck()
results = factcheck.check_text("Protests in Nepal occurred due to social media bans")
# Results now have better context preservation!
```

## üìà Impact Summary

The enhanced claim decomposition successfully solves the original problem while maintaining full compatibility with existing code. Users now get more accurate fact-checking results without changing how they interact with the system.
